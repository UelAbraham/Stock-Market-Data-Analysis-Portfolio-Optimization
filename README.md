Project Overview

This project aims to:

	•	Fetch historical stock data using the Alpha Vantage API.
	•	Calculate financial ratios like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio.
	•	Build a stock portfolio and calculate its total value.
	•	Analyze stock trends using technical indicators such as moving averages.
	•	Calculate the Sharpe Ratio to assess risk-adjusted returns.
	•	Perform sentiment analysis on stock-related news articles.
	•	Save the processed data to a SQL database for future analysis.

Features

	•	Data Fetching: Retrieves up to 20 years of historical stock data.
	•	Financial Analysis: Calculates P/E ratios, moving averages, and Sharpe Ratios.
	•	Portfolio Management: Simulates a stock portfolio and computes its total value.
	•	Visualization: Plots stock prices along with technical indicators.
	•	Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of news articles related to stocks.
	•	Data Persistence: Saves data to a SQL database for persistent storage.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Alpha Vantage API Key: Get a free API key
	•	Database Setup: SQLite or PostgreSQL (for saving data to a database)

Python Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt:

requests
pandas
matplotlib
sqlalchemy
newspaper3k
textblob
psycopg2-binary  # Only if using PostgreSQL

Installation

	1.	Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository


	2.	Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file or set environment variables for sensitive information:
	•	ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY: Your Alpha Vantage API key.
	•	DATABASE_URL: Your database connection string.

Usage

1. Fetch Stock Data

In the script, specify the list of stock symbols you want to analyze:

stocks = ['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'AMZN']  # Add or remove stock symbols as needed

Run the script:

python stock_analysis.py

2. Build Portfolio and Calculate Value

Define your portfolio in the script:

portfolio = {
    'AAPL': 10,  # Number of shares for Apple
    'TSLA': 5,   # Number of shares for Tesla
    'AMZN': 2    # Number of shares for Amazon
}

The script will calculate and display the total portfolio value.

3. Plot Stock Data

The script will generate plots for each stock, showing:

	•	Closing prices
	•	50-day moving average
	•	200-day moving average

4. Calculate Sharpe Ratios

The script calculates the Sharpe Ratio for each stock and displays the results.

5. Sentiment Analysis on News Articles

Specify the URL of a news article related to the stock:

news_url = 'https://www.example.com/news-article-about-stock'

The script will perform sentiment analysis and indicate whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

6. Save Data to SQL Database

Specify your database URL:

	•	For SQLite (default in the script):

db_url = 'sqlite:///stock_data.db'


	•	For PostgreSQL:

db_url = 'postgresql://username:password@localhost/stock_data'



The script will save the stock data to the specified database.

Concepts Explained

API and Data Fetching

	•	Alpha Vantage API: Used to fetch historical stock data.
	•	HTTP Requests: The requests library sends HTTP requests to the API.

Data Manipulation with Pandas

	•	DataFrames: Used to store and manipulate tabular data.
	•	Calculations: Computing financial ratios and technical indicators.

Financial Metrics

	•	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Stock price divided by earnings per share.
	•	Moving Averages: Used to smooth out price data to identify trends.
	•	Sharpe Ratio: Measures risk-adjusted return of an investment.

Portfolio Management

	•	Portfolio Valuation: Calculates the total value based on the number of shares and current stock prices.

Visualization

	•	Matplotlib: Used for plotting stock prices and moving averages.

Sentiment Analysis

	•	Newspaper3k: Library for extracting and parsing news articles.
	•	TextBlob: Performs sentiment analysis on text data.

Data Storage

	•	SQLAlchemy: Facilitates interaction with SQL databases.
	•	Data Persistence: Stores processed data for future use.

Next Steps

	•	Enhance Error Handling: Improve exception handling for API requests and data parsing.
	•	Expand Sentiment Analysis: Analyze multiple news articles and aggregate sentiment scores.
	•	Portfolio Optimization: Implement optimization algorithms to balance risk and return.
	•	Interactive Dashboard: Use frameworks like Streamlit or Dash for data visualization.
	•	Unit Testing: Add tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.
